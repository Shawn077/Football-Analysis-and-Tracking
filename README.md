# Football-Analysis-and-Tracking
This project focuses on detecting and tracking players, referees, and footballs in a video using YOLO, a powerful AI object detection model. To enhance accuracy, we will train the model further. Players will be assigned to teams based on t-shirt colors using KMeans clustering for pixel segmentation. With this data, we can analyze a teamâ€™s ball possession percentage. Optical flow will be employed to track camera movement between frames, ensuring precise player movement detection. Additionally, perspective transformation will be applied to account for depth, allowing movement measurements in meters rather than pixels. Finally, we will calculate each player's speed and distance covered. This project integrates multiple concepts, such as computer vision, object tracking, and motion analysis, making it valuable for both beginners and experienced machine learning engineers.  

**Modules Used:**  
- **YOLO** for object detection  
- **KMeans** for color-based team classification  
- **Optical Flow** for camera movement  
- **Perspective Transformation** for depth representation  
- **Speed & distance calculation**
