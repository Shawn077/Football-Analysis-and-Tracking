# Football-Analysis-and-Tracking
This project uses YOLO to track players, referees, and footballs. KMeans clustering assigns teams by t-shirt color for ball possession analysis. Optical flow tracks camera movement, and perspective transformation measures movement in meters. Finally, we calculate player speed and distance, making it a great project for all skill levels.
